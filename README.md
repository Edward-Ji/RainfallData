# RainfallData

## Challenge Task One
Far North Queensland is experiencing its worst flooding event in many years. The Bureau of Meteorology would like you to develop a Python program using the PyCharm IDE for one of the levels below:
### Level One
Write a program that will allow a user to enter rainfall data for a week. The program should then be able to allow the user to choose any single day of the week and display the day and rainfall data for that day.
### Level Two
Write a program that will allow a user to enter rainfall data for a week. The program should then be able to allow the user to choose any single day of the week and display the day and rainfall data for that day. The program should also be able to calculate and display the average rainfall for the week.
### Level Three
Write a program that will allow a user to enter rainfall data for a given month and then display the lowest and highest rainfall amounts. The program should also calculate an average for the month.
### Level Four
Same as level Three although the data should be input from an existing CSV file.
